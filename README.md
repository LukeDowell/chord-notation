I spent some time reading the MIDI spec and the MIDI api reference. Upon finding that firefox
does not yet support the MIDI api but that there are in-flight tickets to test compatibility as of
three (!!!) days ago, I almost distracted myself by seeing if I could pick Rust back up and contribute.
Instead, I switched to using chrome for local development. 

I got my repo all set up and set about getting a "hello world" for the MIDI api going. My first
hurdle was that my piano is about 20 feet away from my home computer, and I didn't want to run a giant
cable or work off my laptop and test with my physical piano. I needed to find a way to test locally
on my machine and emulate a piano connection. Something I had not considered was that this would be non-trivial;
a quote from the VPMK site: "To connect hardware MIDI devices you need physical MIDI cables. To connect MIDI software you need virtual cables." 
I tried a few different solutions but settled on using VMPK (Virtual Midi Piano Keyboard - https://vmpk.sourceforge.io/) and loopMIDI (https://www.tobias-erichsen.de/software/loopmidi.html).
Thank you Mr. Tobias Erichsen!

I fired up both pieces of software, configured VMPK to point to the port created by loopMIDI and voila, I could see a 
registered input in my console log of the MIDIAccess object returned by the MIDI api.
